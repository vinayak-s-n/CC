Hi Vinayak Narayankar here

CC for May 12 2020

Instructor had asked us to create a pokedex and classify them in types i.e fire, grass etc. And also use html tables to display their names and image.

i have used the same idea here but instead of pokemons i have used vertebrates. 
hope not sticking to the context but sticking to the concept is fine. 

thank you.
